# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis system to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. Using machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP), the model processes and analyzes textual data to derive sentiment insights.

**Note**: This project is for educational purposes only.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization for efficient text analysis.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Categorizes text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes algorithms like logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or neural networks for classification.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights through visualizations such as word clouds and confusion matrices.

## File Structure

1. **`main.py`**:
   - Core script to load data, preprocess text, train the sentiment analysis model, and evaluate its performance.

2. **`requirements.txt`**:
   - Lists all dependencies required to run the project.

3. **Dataset**:
   - A labeled dataset for training and testing the sentiment analysis model (e.g., tweets, reviews).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaviKunapareddy/Sentiment-Analysis.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis
   ```


## Usage

### Train and Test the Model
1. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory.
2. Run `main.py` to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the sentiment analysis model.
   - Evaluate the model on test data.

### Example Command
```bash
python main.py --dataset data/reviews.csv --model logistic_regression
```

## Example Outputs

- **Input**: "I love this product!"
- **Output**: Positive sentiment

- **Input**: "This is the worst experience ever."
- **Output**: Negative sentiment

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Future Enhancements

- Implement deep learning models such as LSTMs or transformers for better accuracy.
- Extend the system for multi-language sentiment analysis.
- Build a user-friendly interface for real-time sentiment analysis.
